# Game Description
# ----------------------------------------------
# Project Distorted is a physics-based combat focused platformer.
# The main character and the story behind them is currently a work in progress.
# The goal of this game is to discover the backstory behind the main character by progressing through the game.
# The player can use multiple types of swords to fight the enemies they come across.
# The movement in this game is mostly physics-based along with parts of combat are too.
# To go with their weapons, the player will have abilities related to physics topics, like slowing down time, changing gravity, etc.
# There will be bosses the player has to defeat on their journey and difficult parkour they have to cross
# This game will be difficult to learn the best way to control it, however I believe the process of learning will be fun to both develop and play.
